# Mastering PHP

Master Object-Oriented PHP, PHPUnit, Design Patterns, and Dependency Management

## Abstract Classes

1. **Extending**: Abstract classes can be extended using the `extend` keyword.
2. **Contents**: They can contain properties, methods, and abstract methods.
3. **Purpose**: Abstract classes are used to provide base functionality for a group of related classes.
4. **Abstract Methods**: These methods must be implemented in the extending class.
5. **Method Body**: Abstract methods do not have a body.

## Interfaces

1. **Contract Definition**: Interfaces define a contract for a class to implement.
2. **Abstract Methods**: Interfaces can only contain abstract methods.
3. **Purpose**: They are used to define common functionality.
4. **Implementation**: An interface does not concern itself with how the implementing class defines the methods.
5. **Utility**: Interfaces are useful for defining common functionality for multiple classes.
6. **Keyword**: Interfaces are implemented using the `implements` keyword.

## Traits

1. **Functionality Reuse**: Traits allow you to reuse functionality across multiple classes.
2. **Keyword**: Traits are implemented using the `use` keyword.
3. **Contents**: Traits can contain properties and methods.

## Method Chaining

Method chaining is a design pattern that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code, enhancing readability and reducing the number of lines. To use method chaining, call one method on an object and then another method on the same object without assigning the result of the first method call to a variable. For example:

```php
$car = new Car();
$car->setColor('red')->setEngine('V8')->setWheels(4);




This `README.md` provides a structured overview of abstract classes, interfaces, traits, and method chaining in PHP, making it easy for readers to understand and implement these concepts in their projects.
